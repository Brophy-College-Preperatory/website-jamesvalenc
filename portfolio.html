  <h2>Let's look at some numbers:</h2>
<p> Current NBA stats below:</p>

	<p> College stats below:</p>

  <p> Basically what these numbers show, is that Bronny gives absolutely ZERO offensive production. He is running up and down the hardwood for 20 minutes just working on his cardio. 
  <p>This is ridiculous!!!</p>
  <p>Dare I say... preposterous?</p>

  <h2>Fraud..?</h2>

  <p>As previously stated, Bronny just isn't basketball ready, let alone NBA ready. It's a shame that GM's threw this big of a task upon James Jr., and foolish of them not to realize the failure of past coaches to prepare him for this. Orrrr, maybe they knew he wouldn't be ready, so they didn't expend energy on him, and maybe that's why he didn't start or play in clutch time. </p>
  <p>Hmmmm, I wonder!</p>
