  <h2> What are we really analyzing?</h2>
  <p> Ahhh Yes, Bronny James.</p>
  <br>
  <p style="text-indent: 20px;">Let's be frank with ourselves, the only reason this page exists is so we can break down the travesty of a player Bronny really is. Now I don't mean to completely bash on the image of Bronny, rather I propose that you'd think of it as constructive criticism. What exactly are we "constructively criticizng"? Well that's an excellent question! In the paragraphs below you will find the following topics discussed: Offensive performance, defensive performance, transitional play, the overall situation he was placed in, and plausible reasons for why he was placed in this very situation.</p>

 <h2> Offensive game</h2>
  <p style="text-indent: 20px;">Alright, let's talk offense. It's the name of the game. Put the ball in the hoop. That's a vital reason why we separate these players in the NBA from college, the players in college from highschool, and the players on varsity from J.V. A very high majority of these players at the next level can score the ball significantly better at a much higher volume paired with more than solid efficiency even if scoring isn't their forte. This is very evident in statistics, with players like Jayson Tatum averaging near 30 points in highschool and sub 17 points and 7 boards in college (above average collegiate numbers given the time). </p>
  <p style="text-indent: 20px;"> Zion Williamson is another NBA who averaged far more than 30 points in his senior season (36.4 ppg) and then took a leap to 23 points and 9 reabounds a game in college. Why don't we take a look at Bronny now. According the USC trojans website they say in high school "he averaged 13.8 points, 5.5 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 1.8 steals as a senior." That is AT BEST a highschool role player. Those numbers alone say he isn't even college ready!! Now his shooting splits weren't terrible but still not a high enough volume to keep up with his peers or show that he's ready for the next level. </p>

  <h2> Does he deserve it?</h2>
  <p style="text-indent: 20px;"> One might ask, why is he here then? Why is he in the league if he's been so terrible? Why does Bronny James deserve to be in the league if there's FAR better talent that is FAR more deserving of the position he's in. I mean he did work for it though right? Well of course he did, I think, but hard work doesn't always lead to success, right? Well in his case it does, but what about the other hard workers? The other thousands of players who have genuine talent who day in and day out showcase that they're ready to make it to the next level? Well, we'll never know, all because his father and the NBA tried to pull a publicity stunt- <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">"Lebron James and Bronny: The first Father-Son duo to play together in NBA History".</span>  Awesome, but all this for coaches and GM's to just now realize he's failing and is sooner than later just freshmeat for the G-league. Which is not to mention, full of hungry players waiting to be called up to the big leagues. Bronny doesn't have that hunger, that tenacity, because he's always known pops was gonna make it happen. So did he deserve it?</p>              

    <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 150%;"> Nope, not even a piece of it.</span>
